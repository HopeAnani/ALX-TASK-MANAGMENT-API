Functional Requirements:

1 Task Management (CRUD):

    Implement the ability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tasks.
    Each task should have the following attributes: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority Level (e.g., Low, Medium, High), and Status (e.g., Pending, Completed).
    Ensure validations such as a due date in the future, priority level restrictions, and proper status updates.

2 Users Management (CRUD):

    Implement CRUD operations for users.
    A user should have a unique Username, Email, and Password.
    Ensure that each user can manage their own tasks and has no access to tasks of other users.

3 Mark Tasks as Complete or Incomplete:

    Create an endpoint to allow users to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
    Ensure that once a task is marked as complete, it cannot be edited unless reverted to incomplete.
    Add a timestamp for when a task is marked as complete.

4 Task Filters and Sorting:

    Create an endpoint to list tasks with optional filters for Status (Pending or Completed), Priority, and Due Date.
    Allow tasks to be sorted by Due Date or Priority Level
